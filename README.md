## Description
This application is built to help you challenge youself on your coding knowlege by taking a short quiz to see if you can get the highest score. Your Highests scores are visible on the "High Scores" page, with the highest scores on top!

Motivation / Inspiration: 
- I was inspiried by Mega Man II start menu, wanting to give this quiz an old retro feel. Rather than just having the score be based on just the number of seconds remaining. I had it factor in the ((total number of correct answers + Time Left) * 252) to give the score a more 80s arcade feel with the score being a rather large number and only 3 characters for your initials.
